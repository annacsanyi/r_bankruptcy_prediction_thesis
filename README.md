## Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction Thesis
This repository contains the code and results from my masterâ€™s thesis, which examined the predictive performance of different machine learning models for forecasting corporate bankruptcies. The study combines firm-level financial data with industry and macroeconomic indicators, and introduces a stress testing framework to assess model robustness under crisis conditions.

### Project Overview
- Objective: Compare the effectiveness of traditional and machine learning models in predicting corporate bankruptcy.
- Data: Firm-level financial indicators, complemented by industry and macroeconomic variables.

### Models Tested:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Network
Evaluation Metrics: AUC, F1-score, recall, precision

### Key Findings
- XGBoost consistently outperformed the other models across most settings.
- Random Forest showed stable performance and fewer false positives, making it useful in regulatory contexts.
- Logistic Regression remained valuable for interpretability and recall, especially with macroeconomic variables.
- Neural Network performance was limited by class imbalance and technical constraints in R.
- The stress testing framework revealed how models react under economic crises (e.g., 2008, COVID-19), though it remained static in design.

### Contributions
- Demonstrates the strengths of ensemble learning in imbalanced classification problems.
- Introduces a replicable macroeconomic stress testing framework for bankruptcy prediction.
- Highlights the continuing importance of firm-level fundamentals in risk forecasting.

### Limitations & Future Directions
- Models were limited to a one-year prediction horizon.
- Static stress testing design could be expanded into dynamic, time-aware models (e.g., RNNs).
- Only accounting-based indicators were used; adding market-based data (equity volatility, credit spreads, etc.) could improve early warning.
- Extension to non-US firms would broaden applicability.

### Tools & Languages
- R (caret, randomForest, xgboost, tensorflow, ggplot2)
